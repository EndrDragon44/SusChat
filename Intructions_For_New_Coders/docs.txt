        DOCUMENTATION FOR NEW MEMBERS
-----------------------------------------------
                    Intro
              ----------------
            Hello. If you're reading this, you most likely got invited here by either me (Tanner) or Emmet. This is the SusChat Foundation. We are working on this social media, and you are too. This is the helpful documentation written by Tanner for you to reference.
              ----------------
            1. Basic CSS
          ---------------
    Let's face it, you gotta start somewhere. You can't become super hackers like me and Emmet in a day. We're probably gonna start you off managing the CSS portion of things. If you don't know what CSS is, why the hell did we let you onto this project?!?!? Jokes aside, CSS is what makes the page look pretty. You're job is simple. If we severely mess up the looks of the page, you clean up our mess. If you do a good job, we promote you to our next position.

            2. HTML
            --------
          So, you're good at CSS. That's nice and all, but now you're on the real stuff. You're gonna work on HTML. You basically add tags and give them IDs (for me to handle).  This is a good position and is rather respectable. When you eventually get promoted, you will become a JavaScript Dev.
            --------
          3. JavaScript

      Congrats. If you made it this far, you must reall
